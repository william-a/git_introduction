## Git Basics
To initalize a directory as a git repository, you first must type the command...
 `git init`

Next, you want to add a file to that repository, this is done with the command...
`git add [FILE_NAME]`

This should be done for each file in the directory that you want to stage. Staging a file saves the current state of the file, so that when a commit happens, it is that state of the file that is commited.
